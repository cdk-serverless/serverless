## Conclusion

Based on our findings, we believe AWS Lambda is a viable solution for reducing server costs by migrating LESS compilation from our existing servers to AWS Lambda.

Another area AWS Lambda could be leveraged to reduce server costs is in response to events like batch processes. Moreover, tools that do not require much traffic like internal tools can benefit from AWS Lambda because provisioning, usage, and computation costs are relatively free.
